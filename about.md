I am currently studying computer science at the University of Calgary. My interests include Information Security, Networks, and Software Engineering.

I have worked previously as a frontend developer and designer. I am proficient in Java, Python, C#, and have knowledge of many others, including Ruby, C, C++.

I am a fan of *NIX based operating systems and am always trying to improve my command line skills and knowledge. Recently, I have been exploring the pen-testing distro Kali.

I also have a degree in Philosophy and English Literature from the University of Glasgow.
