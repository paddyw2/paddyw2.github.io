I am currently studying computer science at the University of Calgary. My interests include Software Engineering, Big Data, and Networks.

I have worked previously as a frontend developer and designer, and as a software developer. I am proficient in Java, Python, C#, and have knowledge of many others, including C, C++, Ruby and JavaScript.

I am a fan of *NIX based operating systems and am always trying to improve my command line skills and knowledge.

I also have a degree in Philosophy and English Literature from the University of Glasgow.
